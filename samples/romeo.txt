There are two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. These two families don’t get along. They both live in the city of Verona. From these families, one son from the Montagues and one daughter from the Capulets were meant to be together. To stop their families from fighting, these two kill themselves. Ultimately, the families learn a lesson and stop their feud.
